three.js-experiments
====================

This is where I play around with the amazeballs [three.js](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/). You can view it in your browser here: http://grantmd.github.com/three.js-experiments/

Besides three.js, I use the following projects:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Physijs](https://github.com/chandlerprall/Physijs)
* [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/)
